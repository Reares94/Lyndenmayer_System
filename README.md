# Lyndenmayer_System
3D plants generation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project renders three-dimensional L-systems using Javascript with Three.js framework which is based on WebGL.
In the scene, specifically on the pitch, you can plant different types of trees that are modeled according to the L-system theory.

How can I produce the results? 

1 You have to click with the mouse on the ground
